# Customer Segmentation

## Overview

Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing the anonymized customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing, such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits.

It is very relevant for management to calculate some satisfied consumers of a particular market and consumer service. To achieve this, we added the study of PCA, factor, and regression to our data points, and then by normalization, we created a best-suited model. Eventually, the model explains the effectiveness of a given set of customers happy list. All these measurements are then systematically presented to measure the happy index.

This data-science-based machine learning project uses K-means clustering, which is the essential algorithm for clustering un-labeled anonymized datasets. The K-means algorithm identifies the K-Number of Centroids and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster while keeping the Centroids as small as possible.
